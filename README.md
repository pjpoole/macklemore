# Macklemore

## (Yet another learning project)

**Macklemore**, a personal finance/budgeting app for people who buy their clothes at thrift shops. You don't have any savings, nor do you have significant stocks or investments, but maybe you own a MacBook and have a lot of student loans?

Aims to (eventually) be a lightweight double-entry bookkeeping system that supports fast user entry, and automation of some common stuff, like getting insights into where your money's going and planning for the future.

## TODO:
