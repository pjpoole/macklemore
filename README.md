* Macklemore

** (Yet another learning project)

**Macklemore**, a personal finance/budgeting app for people who buy their clothes at thrift shops. You don't have any savings, nor do you have significant stocks or investments, but maybe you own a MacBook and have a lot of student loans?

Aims to (eventually) be a lightweight double-entry bookkeeping system that supports fast user entry, and automation of some common stuff, like getting insights into where your money's going and planning for the future.

** TODO:

Model links


** Feature todos:

Bank output dump import (usually csv)
Database backups
Same format export
Future spending planning
Time series events: extensive vocabulary for referring to time (every two weeks until ...)
Filters
Live updates
Javascript frontend: Angular or React
Visualization (probably using d3)
Seriously, lots of visualizations
User accounts (for when it's not local anymore)
Encryption?
